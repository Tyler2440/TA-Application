Comments to Evaluators:

	Just in case we messed up the password between the assignment page and our code, the password for each user is: 123ABC!@#def.
	There are two blank named users in the Edit Roles page because they were test users we added to make sure adding users worked.

Assignment Specific Write-Up:

1) During the assignment, we discovered that you can specifically address pages and actions to specific authorized users, and the process of authenticating the users.
2) We struggled with extra implementations, so we did what the assignment asked for in terms of requirements.
3) We moved our home page bootstrap into the home page for PS5 where we did not have it for PS4, making the site a lot more user-friendly.
