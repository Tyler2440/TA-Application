Assignment Specific Write-Up:

1) During the assignment, we discovered that you can specifically address pages and actions to specific authorized users, and the process of authenticating the users.
2) We struggled with extra implementations, so we did what the assignment asked for in terms of requirements.
3) We moved our home page bootstrap into the home page for PS5 where we did not have it for PS4, making the site a lot more user-friendly.
